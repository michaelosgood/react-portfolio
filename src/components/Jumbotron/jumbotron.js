            My name is Michael Osgood and I am a huge science and tech enthusiast. 
            I am a full-stack web developer. Currently, I am enrolled in a full-stack coding 
            program through the University of California Irvine. I also work as a User Acceptance Tester for a 
            cloud-based software company in Irvine, California. To elaborate on my background, I worked in 
            Public Health for the U.S Air Force. I was stationed at an air base in New Jersey in where I helped 
            protect the local population from environmental threats through preventative measures. This career 
            field spurred my fascination with biology. After four years in the Air Force, I studied Ecology 
            and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado in Boulder. During that time, I studied a 
            myriad of topics to include evolution, genetics, ecology, chemistry, and physics. During college, 
            I started working for a software company in Colorado as a support analyst. After graduation, I moved 
            to California and resumed working on the client-facing side of software for a pharmaceutical software company. 
            After 3 years working on the client-facing side of software, I have become a User Acceptance Tester. I work with 
            developers to test and trouble-shoot the software before it goes to production. In my tenure, I have gained valuable 
            experience from assisting clients on the client-facing side to collaborating with the development team to resolve 
            bugs on the development side. Not only that, I understand how frustrating using poorly-designed software 
            can affect the end-user. This knowledge I accumulated working with software is going to help me become 
            a better developer. Furthermore, I am gaining crucial knowledge in the development and testing of 
            software through the full-stack coding boot camp. The coursework covers many topics from HTML, CSS, 
            JavaScript, jQuery, React.js, MySQL and many other tools that will help me become a full-stack developer.
            The experience I have obtained working for tech companies coupled with the knowledge I am acquiring through
            coding boot camp will help me tremendously as I embark on this path to become a developer.
